## Description

### What needs are we meeting?
* You are on a diet,
    * who needs to keep track of your daily caloric intake,
    * So you need a food tracker.


### What would be the foreseeable consequences if the needs are unmet?
* You will not be able to know how much calorie you have consumed in the day.


### What were your goals?
* Take input from user,
* Save the input on SQL database, and
* Allow user to keep track of what food to eat, and the food that has already been eaten in the day.


### What have you done about it?
* All goals are met.



## Installation

1. All you need is a working computer or phone!
